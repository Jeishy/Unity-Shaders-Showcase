# Unity-Shaders-Showcase

These shaders were created as part of the Optimised Programming for Game Devices 3rd year module at kingston University.

## Brief Description

This project features 4 shaders:
- Fire shader
- Shield shader (with intersection detection)
- Portal shader
- Star shader

These shaders were made using Unity's Shader Graph and the Cg shading language. 
All models were created by Daniel Henshaw, who's YouTube channel I have linked below:
