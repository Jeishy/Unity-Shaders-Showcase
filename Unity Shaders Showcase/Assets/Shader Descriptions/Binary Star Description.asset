  ShaderName: Binary Star System Shader Graph
  Sentence: "The binary system scene features a main sequence star and a dwarf star
    orbiting each other (minus the accretion disk).\nHere, some textures are sampled
    and tiled along the object's x axis at different speeds to give a multi-layered
    affect. \nThere are slight fresnel affects on each of the stars, and both have
    their own corona particle effect systems. There are also depth of field, grain,
    and bloom post-processing effects in the scene.\n"
