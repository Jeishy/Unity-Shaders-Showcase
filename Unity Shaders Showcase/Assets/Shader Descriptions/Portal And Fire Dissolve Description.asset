  ShaderName: Portal, Fire and Dissolve
  Sentence: 'The portals in the scene feature models created by a 3D artist from the
    Game Creation Processes 3rd year module. It also features portal shaders that
    make use of twirl and voronoi auto generated functions from Unity''s shader graph
    documentation.

    The fire shader can be seen on the sides of the fire portal''s door. This shader
    uses the gradient and voronoi auto generated function from the shader graph documentation.

    The dissolve effect behind the portals are an adapted version of the fire shader
    portal, with reduced gradient and voronoi scale.

    There are particle effects for each portal, and animated gems that rotate at the
    top most part of the portal door.'
