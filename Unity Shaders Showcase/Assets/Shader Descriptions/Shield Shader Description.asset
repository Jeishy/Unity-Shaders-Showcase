  ShaderName: Shields Shader Graph
  Sentence: 'These shields were made using Unity''s shader graph. This shield shader
    features intersection detection, the camera''s opaque texture with some gradient
    noise tiled in the object''s y axis, and a simple fresnel affect to add rim light.

    This shader was based on a more complex shield shader found on GitHub (more information
    in my shader''s report).'
